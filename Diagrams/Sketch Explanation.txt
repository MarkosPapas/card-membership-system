BFO Needs to use FCS systems so that their employess can pay for food and beverages by using their card. In order to achieve this, FCS has an interface, that enables companies to upload CSV files of their Employees to be added to the FCS system.For a company to be able to upload a CSV file, FCS provides that company with a token that expires after this CSV file has been uploaded. After a user has been uploaded to the FCS database, that user can then purchage and pay for beverages using their BFO ID card. when a user then decides to register, which is optional, that user follows a URL to the registration page. where that user enters their employee ID and card ID. A get request is then sent to the FCS systems to check if that person exists in the database. if that user exists in the database, they are redirected to another page where they enter their first and last names. if BFO wants to update employee credentials, they will send a put request with the updated credentials of that employee in a JSON file.the FCS API will then, query the database to update this employees details.
